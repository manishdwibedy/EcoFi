# Hello World for MetaMask

A simple hello world for testing metamask

## Prerequisites

Make sure npm is installed. Tested with version 3.5.2 (pretty old, maybe a year old - will test newer when I upgrade)

## Steps to run after npm is available (from the project root):

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will startup a local server. It will puke out something like:

```
[0000] info  Server running at http://127.0.0.1:9000/ (connect)
[0000] info  LiveReload running on 35729
```

Then navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:9000/examples/] (or whatever your machine's IP is set to)
